# Discord Bots
### My discord server bots

## bot.js
General purpose bot. Functionalities include replying to some messages and sending inspirational quotes every morning

## dadBot.js
Your dad, but in JavaScript. Will make dad jokes (even about programming). Used to get mad when you cursed, but we figured we do that too much. Also: 'Hi hungry, I'm dad!'

## nbaBot.js
Currently in beta phase. Tells you if Dallas Mavericks play tonight, if you ask nicely (why Mavs? Luka Dončić). Will also be able to notify you on game start and send the result on game end.
